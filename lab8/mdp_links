High Low Problem

The game High-Low is a card game played with an infinite deck containing three types of cards: 2,3,4(, ie, three states). You start
with a 3 showing(,ie, the start state), and say either higher or lower(2 actions - HIGH or LOW). Then, a new card is flipped; if you say higher and the new card
is higher in value than your current card, you win the points shown on the new card. Similarly, if you say lower and
the new card is lower in value than your current card, you win the points shown on the new card. If the new card is
the same value as your current card, you donâ€™t get any points. Otherwise, the game ends. Your current card is then
discarded and the new card becomes your current card. An example of a game is [3, high, 4, low, 2, high, 3, low, 4, end]
The deck contains different proportions of 2,3, and 4 cards, p2, p3, p4 respectively (where p2 + p3 + p4 = 1).
